Homework Module 3 for ASU Data Bootcamp

## Overview

The objective of the module is to import two different CSV files into Python to perform data analysis. The first one is a time series tracking profit and loss. The second is a collection of election results. 

Both are located within the parent directory, python-challenge and the links to the CSVs should be run from that parent directory. Please reach out through the submission portal if you have any issues while grading the module. 

Thank you!
